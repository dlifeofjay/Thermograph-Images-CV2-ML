  FILE DESCRIPTIONS — Diabetic Foot Complication Analysis Project
====================================================================

1. README.md
   - Project documentation listing all 6 deliverables, architecture,
     getting started instructions, and file references.

2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(Jubril).pdf
   - Full EDA report with visualizations comparing Control vs. DM
     groups. Covers angiosome temperature distributions and TCI values.

3. Preprocessing & Segmentation.pdf
   - Visual validation report demonstrating the Hybrid Segmentation
     technique (Histogram Thresholding + Morphological Operations),
     with results on Cold/Ischemic feet.

4. EVALUATION REPORT.pdf
   - Compiled evaluation report containing diagnostic performance
     metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and confusion matrices
     at both the 1.8°C and 2.6°C threshold levels.

5. Plantar_Thermogram_Database_for_the_Study_of_Diabetic_Foot_Complications.pdf
   - Reference paper / documentation for the thermogram database
     used in this project.

6. Jubril's Notebook & Other Deliverables.ipynb
   - Jupyter Notebook containing executable code for:
       • EDA (data loading, statistical summaries, distribution plots)
       • Preprocessing & segmentation walkthrough
       • Full analysis pipeline (run_full_analysis function)
       • Final Symmetry Report (Delta-T classification, 2.2°C threshold)
       • Sensitivity Analysis — ROC Curve with 1.8°C and 2.6°C markers
       • Classification Reports and Confusion Matrices at both thresholds

7. segmentation.py
   - Core segmentation module. Contains the image_proc() function
     which performs: image standardization → histogram thresholding →
     morphological operations → noise removal. Returns the segmented
     foot image and binary mask.

8. full_pipeline.py
   - End-to-end signal processing pipeline. Contains:
       • pipeline() — orchestrates left/right foot processing
       • extract_and_save_angiosomes() — segments foot into 4 angiosomes
         (MPA, LPA, LCA, MCA), computes mean temperatures, saves CSVs

9. streamlit_app.py
   - Streamlit Diagnostic Dashboard. Features:
       • File upload sidebar (left/right images + CSVs)
       • Global Diagnosis Banner (Normal / Monitoring / Local Risk / Diffuse Risk)
       • 2x5 angiosome segmentation visualization grid
       • Traffic Light Symmetry Metrics (Normal ≤1.8°C, Warning 1.8-2.6°C, High Risk >2.6°C)

10. foot_plot.py
    - Visualization helper script for plotting foot thermogram data.

11. requirements.txt
    - Python package dependencies for the project.

12. packages.txt
    - System-level package dependencies (used for Streamlit Cloud deployment).

13. .gitignore
    - Specifies files and directories excluded from version control.

14. ThermoDataBase/ (directory)
    - Contains the raw thermogram images and CSV temperature data
      for both Control and DM patient groups.
